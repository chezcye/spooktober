# spooktober-code-challenge
Get ready to code up some October fun! ðŸŽƒ Weâ€™re excited to announce the Spooktober Code Challenge, running from October 22 - 29, 2024. The goal is simple: post a snippet of code that has a playful October or Fall twistâ€”whether itâ€™s creating pumpkin ASCII art, showing off a ghostly animation, or using festive color schemes.
